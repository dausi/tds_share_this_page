# tds_share_this_page
The concrete5 built in soical media *Share This Page* buttons do lack the full control over personal data: if you click at a conventional share button without explicit intention there is no way to pull back. The social provider page is opened and your personal browser data consumed by the service provider.

The **TDS Share This Page** solution puts a dialog in between clicking at a *Share This Page* button and the provider page opening... EU-GDPR compliance is established!

**TDS Share This Page** was built from concrete5 built in social media *Share This Page* buttons and utilizes the same database table.
